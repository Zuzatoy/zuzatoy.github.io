                            <p> HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is used to create the basic structure and content of a webpage.
                                CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used for the design of a webpage – where everything is placed and how it looks.
                                JavaScript is used to define the interactive elements of a webpage that help to engage users.
                            </p>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="list-element-bold"> Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. </li>
                            <p>Control flow relates to the order in which tasks or code is run. For example:<br>

                                    Wake up<br>
                                    
                                    Tired => Press snooze<br>
                                    
                                    Not tired => Get out of bed<br>
                                    
                                    Loops on the other hand, iterate over the same peice of code until the condition turns false. For example: <br>
                                    
                                    Go to bathroom and brush teeth<br>
                                    
                                    Are teeth clean?<br>
                                    
                                    No => Action: Up then down<br>
                                    
                                    Yes => Stop Brushing
                            </p>
                        </ul>
        
                        <ul>
                            <li class="list-element-bold"> Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects. </li>
                            <p class ="list-element-bold"> Objects vs Arrays :  </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>you want to store a bunch of numbers, or a list of objects of the same type, use an array.</li>
                                <li>If what you semantically need is an object with a bunch of properties (of varying types), use an object with properties. 
                                That’s pretty efficient in terms of memory, and it’s also pretty fast.</li>
                                <li>Integer-indexed elements, regardless of whether they’re stored in an array or an object, are much faster to iterate over than object propert</li>
                                <li> Properties on objects are quite complex: they can be created with setters, and with differing enumerability and writability. 
                                Items in arrays aren’t able to be customized as heavily — they either exist or they don’t. At an engine level, this allows for more optimization in terms of organizing the memory representing the structure. This is particularly beneficial when the array contains numbers. For example, when you need vectors, don’t define a class with properties x, y, z; use an array instead.</li>
