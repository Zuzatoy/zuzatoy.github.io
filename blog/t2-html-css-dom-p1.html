 <p>
Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? From my perspective, if we will think that WEB-page is a human body that means HTML is a sceleton
DOM is rules how all body works and CSS is how the person look like.

<p>
What is meant by boxifying design? it is rule which simplify design and give the patterns for developers and designers.

 <p>
 What is the box model? Box in CSS is area in the screen which contain optional surrounding padding, border, and margin areas;
