                    <li> What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important. </li>
                    <p>Responsive design can help you solve a lot of problems for your website. It will make your site mobile-friendly, 
                    improve the way it looks on devices with both large and small screens, and increase the amount of time that visitors spend on your site. We live in a multi-screen society. Because of this, it’s important for your site to be viewable across as many devices as possible, 
                    because you never know what device someone will be using to view your website.
                    Responsive website stats suggest that it’s wise to appeal to both desktop and mobile viewers.

                <ul>
                    <li> What mobile first design is, and why it's important. </li>
                    <p>With the advent of cellular technology, mobile phones have become an integral part of everyday life. 
                    Most developers tend to create applications that are desktop oriented, after which they streamline functionality and features for the mobile versions
                    But with the continuous rise of mobile users, it has become necessary to develop applications which are mobile friendly since they are accessed more frequently from such platforms. 
                    The new trend in the market is to develop a mobile friendly version first and then develop for other platforms.</p>
                </ul>
        
                <ul>
                    <li> What frameworks are, and their pros and cons. </li>
                    <p> Frameworks are a kind of programming abstraction that holds together the user-written code. A software framework is a universal, 
                        reusable software environment that provides particular functionality as part of a larger software platform. 
                        Frameworks are fairly similar to libraries and they’ve become a bit of a buzzword recently.   </p>

                <ul>
                 <li> What a wireframe is and why we use it. 
                   <p>Wireframes are simple black and white layouts that outline the specific size and placement of page elements, site features, conversion areas and navigation for your website.</p>
                <ul>
                        <li> Wireframes display site architecture visually</li>
                        <li>Wireframes allow for clarification of website features</li>
                        <li>Wireframes push usability to the forefront</li>
                        <li>Wireframes help make the design process iterative</li>
                        <li>Wireframes save time on the entire project</li>
                </ul>
