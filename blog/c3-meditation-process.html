                            To be honest, I did not know much about meditation before I was reading chapter 2. I thought that meditation  could be useful only for religion proposes not for everybody. 
                            I was quite surprised that meditation could be benefited as well for IT perons.

                <ul>

                    <p>
                   I learn that meditation is things which can be useful for everybody in the modern life and it is not as difficult to begin as I thought.
                    </p>

                    <li="list-element-bold">  Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you? </li>
                    <p> The meditation technique which is quite well work with me is walking meditation.

                <ul>
                    <li="list-element-bold"> Any other musings? </li>
                    <p> I have to spend more time to try meditation properly. As I see it would be great source of energy for me.</p>
