                    <li> What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness? </li>
                    <p> Mindfulness and awareness always complement each other. Mindfulness is the process of relating with individual
                        situations directly, precisely, definitely. Mindfulness is like a microscope; it is neither an offensive
                        nor a defensive weapon in relation to the germs we observe through it. The function of the microscope
                        is just to clearly present what is there. Awareness is seeing the discovery of mindfulness. So mindfulness
                        and awareness work together to bring acceptance of living situations as they are.
                    </p>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li> Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your
                        experience of it? How did you feel? </li>
                    <p>Personally I tried only Body Scan technic and I realised that I always use it when I try to follow sleep.
                        I hope I will try Journaling soon it sounds like something interesting.
                    </p>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li> What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section? </li>
                    <p> My emotions are not me - Shift from “I am angry” to “I feel angry” to “I experience anger in my body”.
                        After training, you will see emotions going from existential “I am” to experiential “I feel”. You
                        will eventually see emotions as physiological phenomena. This is the beginning of your mastery over
                        your emotions. Emotions are like clouds in the sky – the clouds are not the sky; they are phenomena
                        in the sky that comes and go. </p>
