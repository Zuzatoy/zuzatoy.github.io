    <p>
    Which timebox and habits techniques did you try? I try to split big challenge into several small.
    </p>
    <p>
    What did you find interesting? I didnt expect that there is so many ways to better manage time and be more productive. 
    </p>
    <p>
     What worked for you? I dont decide yet Im just trying several technics.  
    </p>
